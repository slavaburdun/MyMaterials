Test the compression filter.  To verify that the content is being compressed,
modify the CompressionFilter class by commenting out line 53 (which sets the
response header Content-Encoding) and redeploy the webapp.  When you view
this page again it will look garbled (the browser will be displaying the binary
data as characters).
